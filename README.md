# Folding@Home GPUs.txt Parsing

This is a little Ruby library to parse
[the Folding@Home GPUs.txt file](http://fah.stanford.edu/file-releases/public/GPUs.txt)
into cute little GPU objects according to
[the official GPUs.txt format specification](https://fah.stanford.edu/projects/FAHClient/wiki/FormatOfGPUsTxt).
